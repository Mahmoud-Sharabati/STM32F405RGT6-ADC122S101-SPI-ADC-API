# STM32F405RGT6-ADC122S101-SPI-ADC-API
This project is a demonstration of how to interface the STM32F405RGT6 microcontroller with an external ADC122S101 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) over the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus. The ADC122S101 is a 12-bit, dual-channel ADC that can measure voltages with 2.7V - 5.25V range
